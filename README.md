# MyMonoGameLibrary

Created by Chris Yang, with the help from the Monogame 2D Getting Started Tutorial (https://docs.monogame.net/articles/tutorials/building_2d_games/)

This contains my class library for my Monogame projects. This class library is pretty much like a simple version of Unity. It supports game objects and components, scenes, tilemaps, camera, collision behavior, input management, and other important parts of a game engine.
