# 2D Game Engine

**Created by Chris Yang**

This contains my class library for my Monogame projects. This class library is pretty much like a simple version of Unity. It supports game objects and components, a simple physics systmem, UI, debugging tools, and other features important for games.

**Game made using this engine:** https://github.com/ChrisYXYang/Summer-Game
